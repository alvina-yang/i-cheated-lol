# i cheated lol 🤣

A Devpost-winning project that helps you "strategically repurpose" hackathon projects. Because why build from scratch when you can build on the shoulders of giants... and then claim their work as your own?

## 🧠 Inspiration

Hackathons are hard. Thinking is hard. Originality? Also hard.

But what if… hear me out… it **didn't** have to be?

After three hours of doomscrolling Devpost, four existential crises, and typing “pls just tell me what to build” into ChatGPT like it was my therapist, I realized something groundbreaking:
There are already thousands of CRACKED projects out there. Why suffer when you can **strategically repurpose existing intellectual capital**?

So I made **i cheated lol** — your one-stop shop for becoming the world’s most productive fraud. It’s for hackers who want to spend more time **vibing and less time crying** over broken components.

## 💻 What It Does

> Basically like Cursor, but for stealing entire projects.

*   🔍 **HackFinder Agent**: Crawls GitHub using the Groq API and your keywords to find the *most clout-maxxing* hackathon repos.
*   🔧 **One-click Rewriting**:
    *   Auto-updates all commits with your GitHub username
    *   Injects AI-generated comments (you know, for "readability")
    *   Renames all variables just in case ykwim?
*   🌐 **Web-based Code Editor**: In case you feel like touching grass is for losers and want to make *actual* changes.
*   📜 **Auto-Pitch Generator**: Don’t know what you built? No problem. We’ll give you a script so good, judges will cry.
*   🤖 **"Make Better" Button**: Click it. It changes stuff. Is it better? Who knows. But now it’s *different*.
*   🚨**"PANIC" Button**: If you get notified for cheating, click this button. It will emergency squash all your commits into one and turn your entire project into a tic-tac-toe game :)
*   🧠 **"Suggest Changes" Button**: This one's basically just cursor, oops. Click it once and it starts hallucinating features like “real-time collaboration” or “crypto wallet integration” and then actually implements them. Congrats, your to-do list just speedran itself into a YC application.

Basically, we turn “bro copied my repo” into “bro rewrote the repo and made it better than me.”

## ⚙️ How We Built It

*   **Groq + GitHub API**: To programmatically identify ~~victims~~ candidates.
*   **LangChain**: For rewriting commits, generating docs, comments, and variable names.
*   **FastAPI**: To handle backend requests faster than your dignity disappears during live debugging.
*   **Next.js**: Because every good scam deserves a clean UI.
*   **Vercel**: Because deployment shouldn't be another thing that breaks your spirit.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. **Prerequisites**

*   Node.js & npm
*   Python 3.8+ & pip
*   A GitHub account (and a questionable moral compass)

### 2. **Setup**

**Clone the repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alvina-yang/i-cheated-lol.git
cd i-cheated-lol
```

**Set up the backend:**

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following:**

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
```

**Set up the frontend:**

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 3. **Run the App**

From the root directory, run the startup script:

```bash
./start.sh
```

This will launch both the frontend and backend servers.

*   **Frontend:** `http://localhost:3000`
*   **Backend API:** `http://localhost:8000`
*   **API Docs:** `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## 🧩 Challenges We Ran Into

*   Refactoring broke stuff. A lot. But that’s future-you’s problem.
*   Accidentally built an actually good project and had to spend 2 hours nerfing it so judges wouldn’t get suspicious.
*   Tried to make it untraceable… accidentally made it unrecoverable.

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments We're (Allegedly) Proud Of

*   Built a project that weaponizes laziness into efficiency.
*   Made the GitHub version of ChatGPT’s “Just write me the code.”

---

## 📚 What We Learned

*   Good artists copy. Great artists use Groq to automate plagiarism.
*   Laziness is just optimization with ✨ branding ✨.
*   If your code breaks and no one saw it, did it really happen?

---

## 🔮 What's Next for *i cheated lol*

*   Auto-generate obscure tech stack choices so you look ✨ innovative ✨ (e.g., “built with Haskell, Rust, and vibes”).
*   Maybe add a disclaimer for legal reasons. Or don’t.
*   Pitch to YC under the name “Stealing-as-a-Service.”
*   Beg and plead with MLH so they don't ban me (seriously guys don't, like please don't.... It's just a joke don't do it.)
